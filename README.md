This is a sandbox project for learning the nuances of setting up jest-enzyme for unit testing react components written with typescript.

## Resources

I referenced the following two tutorials on for the setup:

- [Using Jest With TypeScript](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/testing/jest.md#step-2-configure-jest)
- [Configuring Jest and Enzyme in CRA on TypeScript](https://thetrevorharmon.com/blog/configuring-jest-and-enzyme-in-create-react-app-on-typescript)
